## Discussion Prompt

**Discussion Question:**

*"Scaling content production with AI tools like Writesonic raises important questions about content quality, uniqueness, and search engine penalties. Google's stance on AI-generated content emphasizes 'helpful content' over the method of creation. However, at scale, how do we maintain the human touch, originality, and genuine expertise that makes content truly valuable? Share your thoughts on sustainable content production at scale: What guardrails and quality control measures should businesses implement when using AI for bulk content creation? Where do you draw the line between efficiency and authenticity?"*

Respond to this prompt (300-350 words) and engage with at least two classmates' responses. Consider sharing specific examples or workflows that help maintain quality at scale.
