## Discussion Prompt

**Discussion Question:**

*"As AI-powered search becomes more prevalent, some experts predict a significant reduction in website traffic as users get answers directly from AI systems without clicking through. How should businesses adapt their content strategy to remain visible and valuable in this new landscape? Discuss potential business models, content strategies, and ways to maintain audience engagement when AI systems may be serving your content without driving traffic to your site. What role does brand building play in this shift?"*
