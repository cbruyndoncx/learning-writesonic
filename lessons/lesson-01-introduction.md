## Tips and Best Practices

### For Beginners:
- **Start Simple**: Begin with shorter content templates before tackling long-form articles
- **Experiment Freely**: Try different templates to understand what each one does
- **Read the Prompts**: Each template has specific input fields – understanding what they ask for is key
- **Generate Multiple Versions**: Don't settle for the first output – try generating 2-3 variations

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- Being too vague with inputs (the AI needs clear direction)
- Expecting perfect output on the first try (AI assists but doesn't replace human editing)
- Not providing enough context about your target audience
- Forgetting to specify tone and style preferences
