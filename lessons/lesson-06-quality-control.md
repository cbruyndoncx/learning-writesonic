## Hands-on Activity/Assignment

**Assignment: Content Quality Audit and Improvement Project**

This assignment simulates a real-world quality control scenario where you audit, improve, and establish standards for AI-generated content.

**Part 1: Quality Standards Document (500-600 words)**
Create a comprehensive quality standards guide that includes:
- Content quality definition and criteria
- Editorial standards (grammar, style, formatting)
- Brand voice guidelines (tone, personality, do's and don'ts)
- Fact-checking requirements
- Plagiarism thresholds and originality standards
- Approval workflow and roles

**Part 2: Content Audit (300-400 words per piece)**
Take 3 pieces of AI-generated content (either from previous assignments or generate new ones with Writesonic). For each piece:
- Run through plagiarism checker and document results
- Conduct readability analysis
- Identify factual claims that need verification
- Note brand voice consistency issues
- List grammar, clarity, and style improvements needed
- Assign an initial quality score (create your own rubric)

**Part 3: Content Improvement**
Edit and improve all 3 content pieces:
- Fix identified issues
- Verify facts and add citations where needed
- Improve readability and flow
- Enhance brand voice consistency
- Ensure originality and uniqueness
- Document your editing process and changes made

**Part 4: Before/After Analysis (600-700 words)**
Create a comprehensive analysis comparing the original and improved versions:
- Specific improvements made in each piece
- Quality score improvement (using your rubric)
- Readability score changes
- Plagiarism check results (before and after)
- Time invested in editing
- Lessons learned about AI content quality
- Recommendations for preventing similar issues

**Part 5: Quality Control Checklist**
Create a practical, reusable quality control checklist that includes:
- Pre-publication review items
- Tool-based checks (plagiarism, grammar, SEO, readability)
- Manual review points
- Approval sign-offs
- Post-publication monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- Quality standards document
- 3 original AI-generated content pieces
- 3 edited/improved versions
- Audit reports for each piece
- Before/after analysis document
- Quality control checklist template

## Discussion Prompt

**Discussion Question:**

*"There's an ongoing debate about the level of human intervention required for AI-generated content. Some argue that heavy editing defeats the purpose of AI efficiency, while others maintain that thorough human review is essential for quality and authenticity. Where do you stand on this spectrum? Consider factors such as: content type (blog posts vs. social media), target audience sophistication, industry regulations, and brand reputation risks. How much editing is 'too much' and how little is 'too little'? Share your perspective on finding the right balance, and discuss scenarios where you might adjust your quality control intensity."*

Respond to this prompt (300-350 words) and engage with at least two classmates' responses. Consider sharing specific examples from your own editing experience in this course.
